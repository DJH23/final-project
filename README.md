completed sign up/in pages structure <br>
added colours into input fields <br>
tried but failed to implement onClick behaviour in input fields to toggle to secondary colour (see line 51 of SignIn component) <br>
would like onClick behaviour to toggle to the 2nd colour and appear in a strong colour and then have 250ms transition to 25% opacity <br>
added ease-in/out transition delay to buttons <br>
changed svg <br>
tried but failed to adjust size of svg <br>
located CSS animation to be implemented in background (https://www.sliderrevolution.com/resources/css-animated-background/). Didn't try to implement as was worried about breaking something <br>
tomorrow I want to finish the structure of the main page <br>


finished main page layout except a little of the task items
still haven't sorted the functionality for the task items
