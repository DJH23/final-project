completed sign up/in pages structure
added colours into input fields
tried but failed to implement onClick behaviour in input fields to toggle to secondary colour (see line 51 of SignIn component) 
would like onClick behaviour to toggle to the 2nd colour and appear in a strong colour and then have 250ms transition to 25% opacity
added ease-in/out transition delay to buttons
changed svg
tried but failed to adjust size of svg
located CSS animation to be implemented in background (https://www.sliderrevolution.com/resources/css-animated-background/). Didn't try to implement as was worried about breaking something
tomorrow I want to finish the structure of the main page
